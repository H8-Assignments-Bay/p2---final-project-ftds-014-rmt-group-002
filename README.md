<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


From a marketing perspective, it makes perfect sense to put in the effort to understand the characteristics and preferences of your best customers and keep sustaining your business. In this project, we predict customer segmentation and its actionable insight to push your marketing personalized programs at their best for the customer and boost your sales performance (with RFM Analysis). We are using the dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci?select=online_retail_II.csv)

Please feel free to visit our deployment app [here](https://customer-segmentation-uk.herokuapp.com)

6 Customer Segmentation were created during our project, and each segment was highly correlated with RFM ideal segmentation (Success: Champions, Potential Loyalists, About to Sleep, At Risk, Hibernating, and Lost Customer). We learned that based on our reference (Pareto Principle), our Customer Segmentation model could help business improve their M/S by up to 16%.
